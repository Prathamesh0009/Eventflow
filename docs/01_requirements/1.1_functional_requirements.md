# Phase 1.1 – Functional Requirements

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **functional requirements** of EventFlow. Functional requirements describe *what the system must do* from a user and system interaction perspective, independent of implementation details.

These requirements form the contractual basis for all architectural, database, API, and frontend design decisions in later phases.

---

## 2. Requirement Scope

The functional requirements defined here apply strictly to the **MVP version** of EventFlow. Advanced analytics, machine learning, and real-time stream processing are explicitly out of scope and will be addressed in the product roadmap.

---

## 3. Actors

The system recognizes the following actors:

* **User**: Any authenticated entity interacting with the system
* **Frontend Client**: Web application consuming EventFlow APIs
* **Event Producer**: Any service or client emitting events
* **System**: EventFlow backend services

---

## 4. Event Ingestion Requirements

### FR-01: Event Submission

The system shall provide an API endpoint to accept structured event data from authenticated clients.

### FR-02: Event Schema Validation

The system shall validate incoming events against predefined schemas before acceptance.

### FR-03: Mandatory Event Metadata

Each event shall include mandatory metadata such as:

* Event type
* Timestamp
* Source
* Producer identifier

### FR-04: Rejection of Invalid Events

The system shall reject events that fail schema or authentication validation and return appropriate error responses.

---

## 5. Authentication and Authorization

### FR-05: Client Authentication

The system shall authenticate clients using token-based authentication mechanisms.

### FR-06: Authorization Enforcement

The system shall ensure that only authorized clients can submit or access event data.

---

## 6. Event Storage Requirements

### FR-07: Persistent Event Storage

The system shall persist accepted events in a durable storage system.

### FR-08: Immutable Event Records

Stored events shall be immutable once persisted.

### FR-09: Time-Ordered Storage

The system shall store events with time-ordering capabilities to support temporal queries.

---

## 7. Event Retrieval and Visibility

### FR-10: Event Query API

The system shall provide APIs to retrieve events based on filters such as:

* Event type
* Time range
* Source

### FR-11: Pagination Support

The system shall support pagination for event retrieval to handle large result sets.

---

## 8. Event Lifecycle Management

### FR-12: Event Acknowledgement

The system shall acknowledge successful event ingestion to the client.

### FR-13: Event Status Tracking

The system shall internally track the processing status of events.

---

## 9. Audit and Traceability

### FR-14: Event Audit Logs

The system shall maintain audit logs for event ingestion and access.

### FR-15: Traceability

The system shall allow tracing an event from ingestion through storage.

---

## 10. Error Handling

### FR-16: Structured Error Responses

The system shall return structured error responses for failed requests.

### FR-17: Failure Isolation

Failure in processing one event shall not impact the ingestion of other events.

---

## 11. Administrative Capabilities (MVP)

### FR-18: System Health Endpoint

The system shall expose a health check endpoint.

### FR-19: Basic Metrics Exposure

The system shall expose basic system metrics such as event ingestion count.

---

## 12. Explicit Exclusions

The system shall not provide:

* Real-time dashboards
* Advanced analytics queries
* Machine learning inference

These capabilities are deferred to future phases.

---

## 13. Summary

These functional requirements define the minimum viable capabilities of EventFlow. All subsequent system design, architectural decisions, and implementation steps must directly trace back to the requirements defined in this document.
