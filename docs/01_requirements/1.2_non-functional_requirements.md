# Phase 1.2 – Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **non-functional requirements (NFRs)** of EventFlow. Non-functional requirements describe *how the system should behave* rather than *what it should do*. They establish quality attributes and constraints that guide architectural, infrastructural, and implementation decisions.

These requirements are critical for ensuring that EventFlow is reliable, scalable, secure, and maintainable in real-world production environments.

---

## 2. Performance Requirements

### NFR-01: Event Ingestion Latency

The system shall acknowledge accepted event submissions within a predictable and bounded response time under normal operating conditions.

### NFR-02: Throughput Handling

The system shall be capable of handling increasing event ingestion volume through horizontal scaling without requiring architectural changes.

### NFR-03: Query Performance

Event retrieval APIs shall support efficient filtering and pagination to prevent performance degradation for large datasets.

---

## 3. Scalability Requirements

### NFR-04: Horizontal Scalability

All core backend services shall be stateless and support horizontal scaling.

### NFR-05: Storage Scalability

The event storage layer shall support growth in data volume without requiring schema redesign.

---

## 4. Availability and Reliability

### NFR-06: High Availability

The system shall be designed to tolerate individual service failures without complete system outage.

### NFR-07: Fault Isolation

Failures in one component shall not cascade to other components.

### NFR-08: Graceful Degradation

In case of partial system failure, the system shall continue to accept and store events where possible.

---

## 5. Security Requirements

### NFR-09: Authentication Security

All external APIs shall require authenticated access using secure token mechanisms.

### NFR-10: Authorization Controls

Access to event submission and retrieval shall be restricted based on client permissions.

### NFR-11: Data Protection

Sensitive metadata shall be protected both in transit and at rest.

---

## 6. Data Integrity and Consistency

### NFR-12: Event Immutability

Persisted events shall not be modified or deleted through standard application operations.

### NFR-13: Idempotency Support

The system shall support idempotent event submission to prevent duplicate records.

---

## 7. Observability and Monitoring

### NFR-14: Logging

The system shall produce structured logs for critical operations.

### NFR-15: Metrics Collection

Basic system metrics such as ingestion rate and error rate shall be exposed.

### NFR-16: Traceability

Requests and events shall be traceable across system components.

---

## 8. Maintainability and Extensibility

### NFR-17: Modular Design

The system shall be organized into clearly defined modules with explicit responsibilities.

### NFR-18: Schema Evolution

Event schemas shall support versioning to allow controlled evolution over time.

### NFR-19: Backward Compatibility

New system versions shall not break existing event producers.

---

## 9. Deployment and Environment Constraints

### NFR-20: Environment Separation

The system shall support separate development, staging, and production environments.

### NFR-21: Configuration Management

Environment-specific configuration shall be externalized and not hard-coded.

---

## 10. Cost Awareness

### NFR-22: Resource Efficiency

The system shall be designed to operate within reasonable cloud cost constraints, especially for early-stage usage.

---

## 11. Compliance and Auditability

### NFR-23: Audit Support

System actions related to event ingestion and access shall be auditable.

---

## 12. Summary

These non-functional requirements define the quality attributes that EventFlow must satisfy to be considered production-ready. All architectural and implementation decisions in later phases must explicitly support one or more of the non-functional requirements defined in this document.
