# Phase 1.3 – Constraints & Assumptions

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **boundaries** within which EventFlow is designed and the **assumptions** made to keep the MVP focused, realistic, and implementable.

---

## 2. Constraints

Constraints are **deliberate limitations** imposed due to time, scope, resources, or strategic decisions.

### 2.1 Scope Constraints

* EventFlow is **not a real-time streaming system** (e.g., Kafka replacement).
* It does **not guarantee exactly-once delivery** in MVP.
* Advanced features like:

  * Event replay
  * Schema registry
  * Dead-letter queues
  * Multi-region replication
    are **explicitly out of scope** for MVP.

> Reason: These belong to enterprise-grade event platforms and would overcomplicate the initial system.

### 2.2 Technical Constraints

* Backend will be built using **a single technology stack** (no polyglot microservices).
* Initial deployment will target **a single environment** (local + one cloud environment).
* No vendor-specific cloud lock-in (e.g., avoiding managed event buses initially).

> Reason: Keeps the system portable, understandable, and easier to reason about.

### 2.3 Performance Constraints

* MVP is designed for:

  * **Low to moderate event volume**
  * Tens to hundreds of events per second (not millions)
* Latency is **eventual**, not strictly real-time.

> Reason: Focus is correctness, traceability, and architecture — not raw throughput.

### 2.4 Security Constraints

* Authentication will be **basic** (API keys or JWT).
* No enterprise features like:

  * SSO
  * Role hierarchies
  * Fine-grained IAM policies

> Reason: Security is important, but MVP prioritizes **event flow clarity**, not enterprise auth complexity.

### 2.5 Team & Resource Constraints

* Designed to be built by **1 developer**.
* Development time assumed to be **part-time**.
* All design decisions favor:

  * Simplicity
  * Explicitness
  * Low cognitive overhead

> Reason: Project should be **maintainable and explainable by a single person**.

## 3. Assumptions

Assumptions are things considered **true for the purpose of design**, even if they may change later.

### 3.1 User Assumptions

* Users understand:

  * Basic backend concepts
  * APIs and HTTP
  * What events and services are (at a conceptual level)
* Users want:

  * Visibility into system behavior
  * Debuggability over raw speed

### 3.2 System Assumptions

* Events are:

  * JSON-based
  * Schema-consistent per event type
* Event producers are:

  * Trusted services
  * Not malicious actors (for MVP)

### 3.3 Operational Assumptions

* System restarts are acceptable.
* Some event loss may occur during crashes (documented behavior).
* Logs are sufficient for debugging in early stages.

> Reason: MVP prioritizes **learning, clarity, and architecture validation**.

### 3.4 Evolution Assumptions

* EventFlow is expected to evolve incrementally:

  * MVP → Improved reliability → Scalability → Advanced features
* Architectural decisions are made assuming:

  * Components can be swapped later
  * Responsibilities are clearly separated from Day 1
