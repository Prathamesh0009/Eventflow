# Phase 2.2 – Technology Stack Mapping

## 1. Purpose

This document maps **each architectural component** of EventFlow to a **specific technology choice** and explains **why that technology was selected**.

The goal is to ensure that every tech decision is:

* Intentional
* Justified
* Aligned with German job-market expectations (working student & internships)

## 2. High-Level Stack Overview

| Layer                  | Technology                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Frontend               | Next.js (React, TypeScript)    |
| Backend API            | Node.js + NestJS               |
| Authentication         | JWT (Access + Refresh Tokens)  |
| Event Storage          | PostgreSQL                     |
| Cache / Queue (MVP)    | Redis                          |
| Cloud Provider         | AWS                            |
| Containerization       | Docker                         |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform                      |
| CI/CD                  | GitHub Actions                 |
| Observability          | AWS CloudWatch + OpenTelemetry |

## 3. Frontend Stack

### 3.1 Next.js (React + TypeScript)

**Responsibilities:**

* Web dashboard
* Event visualization
* Admin & producer management

**Why Next.js:**

* Industry standard in Germany
* Server-side rendering (SSR) & API routes
* Strong ecosystem & hiring demand
* Works well with cloud deployments

**Why TypeScript:**

* Type safety
* Better collaboration
* Strong signal of production readiness

---

## 4. Backend Stack

### 4.1 Node.js

**Why Node.js:**

* Non-blocking I/O (good for event ingestion)
* Widely used in startups and SMEs
* Strong ecosystem

### 4.2 NestJS (Framework)

**Why NestJS:**

* Opinionated architecture (controllers, services, modules)
* Excellent for scalable backend systems
* Inspired by Spring Boot (very familiar to German companies)
* Built-in support for:

  * Validation
  * Dependency Injection
  * Testing

---

## 5. Authentication & Security

### 5.1 JWT-Based Authentication

**Approach:**

* Access tokens for API calls
* Refresh tokens for session renewal

**Why JWT:**

* Stateless
* Cloud-friendly
* Simple for MVP

**Future extensions:**

* OAuth2
* SSO
* Role-based access control

---

## 6. Data Layer

### 6.1 PostgreSQL (Event Store)

**Why PostgreSQL:**

* ACID-compliant
* Excellent JSON support
* Familiar to recruiters
* Works well with analytics later

**Event Storage Strategy:**

* Append-only table
* Indexed by:

  * Event type
  * Timestamp
  * Source

---

### 6.2 Redis (Cache / Queue)

**Why Redis:**

* Lightweight message buffering
* Fast
* Simple to reason about

**Usage in MVP:**

* Temporary event queue
* Retry handling
* Rate limiting

---

## 7. Cloud Stack (AWS)

### 7.1 Compute

* AWS EC2 or ECS (Docker-based)

### 7.2 Networking

* VPC
* Security Groups
* Load Balancer

### 7.3 Storage & Logs

* AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
* AWS CloudWatch (logs & metrics)

**Why AWS:**

* Strong presence in Germany
* Preferred by startups & mid-sized companies
* Matches your cloud-learning path

---

## 8. Infrastructure & DevOps

### 8.1 Docker

**Why Docker:**

* Environment consistency
* Easy local + cloud deployment

### 8.2 Terraform

**Why Terraform:**

* Declarative infrastructure
* Cloud-agnostic mindset
* Strong DevOps signal

---

## 9. CI/CD

### 9.1 GitHub Actions

**Pipeline Includes:**

* Linting
* Testing
* Build
* Docker image push

**Why GitHub Actions:**

* Native GitHub integration
* Simple & powerful

---

## 10. Observability

### 10.1 Logging & Metrics

* Structured logs
* Request tracing
* Event processing metrics

**Tools:**

* CloudWatch
* OpenTelemetry

---

## 11. Future-Proofing (Intentional Open Ends)

This stack allows easy addition of:

* Kafka / AWS EventBridge
* Data warehouse (Redshift, BigQuery)
* BI tools
* Streaming analytics
